# Neo

We present Neo, a blackbox tool to detect backdoor attacks in Machine Learning models. Please see the paper 
[Model Agnostic Defence against Backdoor Attacks in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02203) for 
more details. 

We evaluate Neo against two attacks, [BadNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06733) and 
[TrojanNN](https://github.com/PurduePAML/TrojanNN/tree/master/data). 

The MNIST and USTS datasets are part of [BadNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06733) whereas 
the VGG-Face dataset are part of [TrojanNN](https://github.com/PurduePAML/TrojanNN/tree/master/data).
